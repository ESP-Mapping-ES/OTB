This example illustrates the use of the LeeImageFilter.
This filter belongs to the family of the edge-preserving smoothing
filters which are usually used for speckle reduction in radar
images. The LeeFilter aplies a linear regression
which minimizes the mean-square error in the frame of a
multiplicative speckle model.
